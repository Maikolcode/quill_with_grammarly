    text: `A man involved in a skiing crash with actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been "affected on many levels" by the resulting injuries, a court has heard.

    A doctor who treated Terry Sanderson said he sustained a traumatic brain injury in the 2016 incident, and it "completely changed his life".

    Dr Alina Fong was speaking on the third day of a civil trial in Utah.

    Ms Paltrow's lawyers argue Mr Sanderson is to blame and point to medical conditions he had before the collision.

    The Oscar winner and lifestyle influencer is countersuing over what her lawyers say is "utter BS".

    Dr Fong, a neuropsychologist, told the court she first saw Mr Sanderson in May 2017.

    He had been "struggling with concussion symptoms for a year and a half" since the incident, she told the court in a video deposition.`
